  <p>In this tab, we explore how different datasets complement our understanding of the functional SuRE data showcased
    in the first tab.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>SuRE Profiles from HLHS Patients:</strong> We start by examining SuRE profiles from HLHS (Hypoplastic
      Left Heart Syndrome) patients, as discussed in the cited <a href="https://google.com">referenced paper</a>. These
      profiles offer insights into how the genomic region behaves functionally within individuals.</li>
    <li><strong>AC16 ATACseq Data:</strong> Since SuRE libraries were introduced into the AC16 Human Cardiomyocyte Cell
      Line, we also examine AC16 ATACseq data that highlights regions of open chromatin within the endogenous AC16
      genome.</li>
  </ol>
