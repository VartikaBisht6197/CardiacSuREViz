    <p>The search bar accommodates inputs in the format "chr:pos" for defining the variant of interest or by specifying
        the gene name. The application queries functionally annotated data from six patients as outlined in the <a href="https://google.com">referenced paper</a>. Genes in the database
        adhere to the RefGene naming format, available for reference at <a
            href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/genes/hg38.ncbiRefSeq.gtf.gz">UCSC Genome
            Browser</a>.</p>

    <h2>Rendered Plot Description</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The rendered plot on this tab comprises two subplots. The bottom plot displays genes within the specified
            region, as defined by the search box and flanking parameters. The top plot visualizes variants within the
            defined region. Each rectangle in the plot represents a variant, with the x-axis indicating the position in
            the genome and the y-axis representing the normalized expression in SuRE.</li>
        
        <li>The bottom of the rectangle starts from the minimum expressing allele of the variant. For instance, at
            position <b>chr12:128797635</b> where the reference allele is T and C is the alternate allele, if T has a mean SuRE
            expression of
            <b>75.32</b> and C has a mean expression of <b>2.47</b>, then the rectangle will be positioned at chr12:128797635
            on the x-axis. The bottom of the rectangle starts at <b>2.47</b> and extends up to <b>75.32</b>, visually
            representing the
            impact of the variant. The opacity and thickness (along the x-axis) of the rectangle indicate the
            significance of the variant.
        </li>
        
        <li>The color of each rectangle indicates whether the maximum expressing allele for a variant is the
            <span style="color: #64BEA5; font-weight: bold;">reference allele</span> or
            <span style="color: #3c5379; font-weight: bold;">alternate allele</span>.
            This interactive visualization allows users to click on variants of interest to center the plot around the selected
            variant.
        </li>
