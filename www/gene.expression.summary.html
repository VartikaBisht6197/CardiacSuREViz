    <p>In this tab, we visualise gene expression of genes within the window shown in the Functional Impact Assessment tab. The data plotted below is a collection of transcriptomic data from multiple sources, including ENCODE, GEO, and
        ArrayExpress. The data encompasses gene expression in:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fetal human heart at developmental stages.</li>
        <li>Fetal tissues during development.</li>
        <li>Healthy (non-failing) adult human heart.</li>
        <li>In-vitro differentiated cardiomyocytes and undifferentiated human embryonic stem cell (H1).</li>
        <li>AC16 cell line where SuRE constructs are transfected.</li>
        <li>Human neural crest cells, an approximation of human neural crest cells that migrate from the neural tube and
            enter the heart from the pharyngeal arches.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To illustrate the utility of this dataset, we highlight the gene expression of TBX18 and GATA4, which are
        known cardiac stem cell marker genes expressed highly during development and HNF4A, which is liver specific gene to show contrast.</p>

    <h2>Data Sources and Descriptions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PGA5W - PGA25W</strong>: scRNAseq data averaged over all cells from GEO accession GSE106118. PGA
            stands for post gestation age and can be compared to Carnegie stages by the table mentioned <a
                href="https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Carnegie_stage_table"
                target="_blank">here</a>. This range covers stages from 5 weeks to 25 weeks post-gestation.</li>

        <li><strong>Adrenal, Brain, Kidney, Liver, Lower limb, Lung, Palate, RPE (Eye), Stomach, Testes, Thyroid,
                Tongue, Upper limb, Ventricle (Heart left ventricle)</strong>: Data from ArrayExpress - Functional
            Genomics Data accession number E-MTAB-3928, from fetal human embryo CS 19-20.</li>

        <li><strong>Adult.Left.Ventricle</strong>: Average of gene expression across 14 healthy non-failing left
            ventricle hearts of individuals in the study GEO accession GSE116250.</li>

        <li><strong>hESC, hVCM</strong>: Data from GEO accession GSE186958. hESC refers to human embryonic stem cells,
            and hVCM refers to in vitro differentiated ventricular cardiomyocytes at day 80 from hESC.</li>
        
        <li><strong>AC16</strong>: Data from GEO accession GSE109716.</li>

        <li><strong>HumanNCC</strong>: Human neural crest cells from ENCODE, GEO accession GSM5330586. These are from a
            female embryo (5 days) neural crest in vitro differentiated cells originated from neural crest cell, i.e.,
            hESCs H9 derived neural crest cells.</li>
    </ul>
