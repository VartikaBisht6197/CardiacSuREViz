    <p>When a variant is selected in Functional Impact Assessment tab, this section aims to assess any potential disruptions to transcription factors (TFs) resulting from the selected variant.</p>

    <h2>Analysis Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Predicted Alignment:</strong> This feature showcases alignments of TFs to both reference (REF) and alternate (ALT) sequences for which the TFBS is affected by the selected variant.</li>
        <li><strong>Predicted Affinity Change:</strong> Right below the predicted alignment you will find tabulated information about the above mentioned TF like motif Id, motif name, TF class , TF family etc. It also gives TFBSi score for change in TF binding
            affinity - REF vs ALT.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For a deeper understanding of the methodology and calculations utilized in predicting affinity changes, it is recommended to refer to the cited <a href="https://google.com">referenced paper</a>.</p>
