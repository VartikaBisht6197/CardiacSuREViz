    <p>In this tab, we explore how different datasets complement our understanding of the functional SuRE data showcased in the first tab.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>SuRE Profiles of Patients:</strong> We start by examining SuRE profiles from congential heart disease patients, as discussed in the cited referenced paper</a>. These profiles offer insights into how the genomic region behaves functionally
            within individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>AC16 ATACseq :</strong> Since SuRE libraries were introduced into the AC16 Human Cardiomyocyte Cell Line, we also examine AC16 ATACseq data that highlights regions of open chromatin within the endogenous AC16 genome.
        </li>
        <li><strong>PhasCon Score :</strong> BigWig track representing conservation scores across 30 mammalian species for the region of interest, highlighting evolutionary conservation patterns within the locus.</li>
    </ol>
