    <p>This tab provides an overview of the files uploaded by the user. The tool supports three input formats:
        <strong>TSV</strong>, <strong>BED</strong>, and <strong>BigWig</strong>. Each file type is used for specific
        purposes and must adhere to specific format requirements, as outlined below:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>TSV Files (MPRA Data):</strong>
            These files must contain exactly 7 columns:
            <ol>
                <li><em>Chromosome</em>: The chromosome where the variant is located. Must start with "chr_".</li>
                <li><em>Position</em>: The exact position of the variant (numeric).</li>
                <li><em>Reference Allele</em>: The original allele at the position.</li>
                <li><em>Alternate Allele</em>: The mutated allele at the position.</li>
                <li><em>Reference Signal</em>: The MPRA signal for the reference allele.</li>
                <li><em>Alternate Signal</em>: The MPRA signal for the alternate allele.</li>
                <li><em>P-value</em>: The statistical significance of the variant in the MPRA data.</li>
            </ol>
            These values are used to generate rectangular visual markers for variants. The height of each rectangle is
            determined by the reference and alternate signals, while the color indicates the allele with higher
            expression. Opacity is influenced by the p-value, allowing significant variants to stand out more clearly.
            These visualizations are consistent with the plots in the <em>Functional Impact Assessment</em> tab.

            <p>When viewing a variant in the SuRE data, if an MPRA TSV file has been uploaded, the application
                cross-checks whether the variant is also present in the uploaded MPRA data. If the variant is found, the
                system highlights it with a yellow line segment, making it easy to spot its position in the uploaded
                data. This highlighting behavior is consistent with the approach used in the <em>Functional Impact
                    Assessment</em> tab.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>BigWig Files:</strong>
            These binary files store genomic data and are processed using the <a
                href="https://rdrr.io/bioc/rtracklayer/man/BigWigFile.html">rtracklayer</a>
            package in R. A small portion of the file is read to ensure it is valid and accessible. If any issues are
            encountered, an error message will be displayed.
        </li>
        <li><strong>BED Files:</strong>
            These files must contain at least 3 columns with no header. The first three columns should include:
            <ol>
                <li>Chromosome</li>
                <li>Start Position</li>
                <li>End Position</li>
            </ol>
            BED files are primarily used for genomic region annotations.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The maximum upload size for any file is <strong>30MB</strong>. Large uploads can impact
        performance and make the application slow or unresponsive. To reduce the size of BigWig or BED files, you can
        subset them:
        <ul>
            <li>To extract data for a specific chromosome, use a tool like <a
                    href="https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/">bcftools</a> or
                <a href="https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/">bedtools</a>.
            </li>
            <li>For BigWig files, use the <code>bigWigToBedGraph</code> utility to convert them to BedGraph, filter for
                your region of interest, and then convert back to BigWig.</li>
            <li>For BED files, extract rows containing the chromosome or region of interest using tools like
                <code>bedtools</code> , <code>awk</code> or a text editor.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="alert">It is not advisable to upload more than 10 files at once. Viewing too many files can result in a
        cluttered and difficult-to-read visualization.</p>
