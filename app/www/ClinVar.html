    <p>When a variant is selected in Functional Impact Assessment tab, this tab enables exploration of the ClinVar database, a publicly accessible
        archive containing reports of human variations classified for diseases and drug responses, along with supporting
        evidence. ClinVar meticulously processes submissions reporting variants found in patient samples,
        classifications for diseases and drug responses, information about the submitter, and other pertinent data.
        Variants are classified into categories such as Likely Pathogenic, Pathogenic, Benign, among others. For further
        information on the classification criteria, please refer to <a
            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/clinsig/">ClinVar's classification documentation</a>.</p>
